# ðŸ§  NLP Project Collection â€“ elevvolabs\_NLPtrack

This repository is a **collection of end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects**, each focusing on a different core skill in text analytics, machine learning, and deep learning.

The projects collectively cover:

* Classic NLP pipelines (preprocessing â†’ vectorization â†’ ML classification)
* Modern transformer-based fine-tuning (BERT/DistilBERT)
* Multi-class and binary classification problems
* Evaluation and visualization of results

Whether you are learning NLP fundamentals or experimenting with state-of-the-art techniques, this repo provides **hands-on examples** of real-world workflows.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

### ðŸŸ¢ 1. Sentiment Analysis

A classic **binary text classification** project demonstrating:

* Text cleaning & normalization (lowercasing, punctuation & stopword removal, lemmatization)
* Feature engineering with **TF-IDF**
* Model comparison: **Logistic Regression vs Naive Bayes**
* Visualizations including **word clouds**

ðŸ“Š **Goal:** Accurately label text as positive or negative and analyze frequent terms in each class.

---

### ðŸ”µ 2. News Category Classification

A **multi-class classification** project using the **AG News dataset**:

* Combined `title` and `description` for stronger features
* Preprocessing + TF-IDF vectorization
* **XGBoost Classifier** for robust performance
* Evaluation with per-class metrics and accuracy

ðŸ“Š **Goal:** Automatically categorize news into **World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech**.

---

### ðŸŸ  3. Fake vs Real News Classification

A **binary classification** project detecting misinformation:

* Preprocess titles and content (remove stopwords, lemmatize, vectorize)
* Train a **Logistic Regression** or **SVM** classifier
* Evaluate with **accuracy** and **F1-score**
* Visualize most common words with word clouds

ðŸ“Š **Goal:** Identify fake news using a reproducible ML pipeline.

---

### ðŸŸ£ 4. Fine-Tuning DistilBERT for Question Answering

A **transformer-based NLP project**:

* Dataset: **SQuAD** (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)
* Preprocessing with truncation, document striding, and offset mapping
* Fine-tuning **distilbert-base-uncased** using the **Hugging Face Trainer API**
* Validation and logging with **Weights & Biases**
* Inference on unseen text to verify model performance

ðŸ“Š **Goal:** Train a lightweight yet powerful model that extracts exact answers from a given context.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

* **Core:** Python, Jupyter Notebook
* **NLP:** NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost
* **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Trainer API
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, WordCloud
* **Experiment Tracking:** Weights & Biases (W\&B)

## ðŸ§­ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Surfing-Cipher/elevvolabs_NLPtrack.git
cd elevvolabs_NLPtrack
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Navigate to a project folder**
   Each folder contains its own notebook or scripts with step-by-step execution.

4. **Run notebooks / scripts**
   Open with Jupyter or VS Code and follow along.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes & Recommendations

* Some datasets are **large (>50 MB)** â€” consider using **Git LFS** to make cloning and pushing more efficient.
* Each project can be extended with:

  * Additional models (e.g., Random Forests, Deep Neural Nets)
  * Hyperparameter tuning
  * Advanced embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT embeddings)
  * Deployment examples (Flask/FastAPI)

Would you like me to also create a **visual directory tree** (showing the folder layout + key files) inside this README so that new visitors instantly see how the repo is organized? That usually makes navigation easier.
